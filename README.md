# Vegetable-Project

Predicting the price of vegetable depending on multiple fields(average temperature, max temperature, min temperature, and amount of rainfall).

You can post this content to your localhost webpage by entering "python server.py"

In a webpage(in my case localhost:5000), you can get predicted price of vegetables if you enter temperatures and amount of rainfalls.

Clone and try on your local environment.
